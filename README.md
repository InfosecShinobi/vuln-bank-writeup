The diagram above shows the high-level architecture of the Vuln-Bank application and how the different vulnerability categories relate to the application components.

## Overview

Vuln-Bank is a (fictional) banking application with numerous security vulnerabilities. This repository documents the vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment, including:

- Authentication and Authorization vulnerabilities
- Data Security issues
- Zero-day vulnerabilities

Each section includes detailed explanations of the vulnerabilities, proof-of-concept exploit scripts, and remediation recommendations.

## Repository Structure

- [Authentication and Authorization](./authentication-authorization/): Vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [Data Security](./data-security/): Vulnerabilities related to data handling and storage
- [Zero-days](./0days/): Previously undocumented vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment

## Methodology

The assessment used a combination of static analysis and dynamic penetration testing:

- **Static Analysis**: Examining the source code to identify potential vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Testing**: Verifying the exploitability of identified vulnerabilities in a running environment

This combined approach provided several advantages:
- **Efficiency**: Static analysis allowed for rapid identification of potential vulnerabilities
- **Comprehensiveness**: Dynamic testing verified the exploitability of the identified vulnerabilities
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Code-level insights made it easier to understand underlying causes
- **Better Remediation**: More precise remediation recommendations could be provided
